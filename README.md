# Updated Urban Dead userscripts
[Urban Dead](http://urbandead.com) is a fantastic online game made by [Kevan Davis](https://kevan.org/). The game has a very simple interface, so numerous userscripts exist to improve the game experience. As of 2020, many of these scripts are broken, so I created this repo to store some updated versions. All credit for the code and art should go to those original creators of the scripts!


## Installation
You must have the Greasemonkey add-on for Firefox installed. To install from here, view the desired script in raw mode. Greasemonkey should automatically detect it.

## Scripts
### [UD Map Skinner](https://github.com/tassaron2/urbandead-userscripts/raw/main/UD_Map_Skinner.user.js)
* Applies images from the classic Firefox add-on, UDToolbar, to the in-game map.

### [UD Inventory Organizer](https://github.com/tassaron2/urbandead-userscripts/raw/main/UD_Inventory_Organizer.user.js)
* Condenses duplicate inventory items and organizes them for easier viewing
